# Fruit maturity and quality
Index used by the US to check the amount of weath produced by URSS during the cold war.

NDVI metric of 
Sentinel data is free

you can seaparate different quality fruits when harvesting

need for high quality even when the harvest is bad

solar radiation, climate data, time of sun exposure

disease

usually the chemical were applied every X days

the informations are shared between all the farmers

metrics:
- first of all sanity
- BRIX grade (sugar content)
- pH
- acidity
- color
- nythrogen in the leaves
- organolectic properties
- fenological phase (using also climate condition), related to plant growth

correlation between fields is possible

- multiplex sensor (very expensive)
- smart grappe

yield estimation through image recognition and weight estimate trhough volume

it's more important the progression than the single value
you cuold use satellite data to choose where to take samples from

yield estimation:
- from the month before harvest
- the number of berries doesn't vary much from plant to plant

yield and quality are related

farmers need tools easy to use
