# Fruitipy
## Precision in fruit picking
- estimate the ripeness of fruit on field
    * for wine we need to track sugar,accid and phenolic content

They already created a portable spectrometer, which also adds some metadata. We'll need to improve the deep learning models that decide whether the fruit is ready to harvest.
The algorithm has now a 98% accuracy on raspberries.

Inetgrating images and spectrometer the algorithm has a 98% accuracy on raspberries.

Using data provided by the spectrometers of Cavit they tuned Fruitipy for grapes
