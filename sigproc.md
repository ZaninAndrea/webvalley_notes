## Spectroscopy
A spectrometer is an object that easures light, the properties of the light will bring memory of chemical characteristics about the fruit.

The wave-length tells you the size of the object the wave will interact with

> **Microwave**
> The microwave emits wave with the right wave-length to interact with water

The spectrum of the sun is a continuous spectrum, whereas different atoms emit different spectres when excited, and those are sparse.

We can also see an absorption spectrum, which is the spectrum of light remaining after a full spectrum light passes through a cloud of gas.

Overlapping the emission and absorption spectrum you get a continuous spectrum

The light coming from a star is partially absorbed by the outer layers of the star, this allows us to get information about the chemical composition of the star.
> **Issues**
> You have to consider that some wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere or by objects in between the source and the spectrograph.

To understand the composition of a planet I can see the variation in the spectrum due to the crossing of the planet in front of the star and the absorption done by the atmosphere

> **Doppler effect**
> Depending on the relative speed of the stars to us the spectrum is shifted towards the red (if they are moving away) or the blue (otherwise)
> 
> We can see that almost all stars are moving away from us, because the universe is expanding.

## Mass Spectroscopy
You have ionized molecules, and being charged you can spread them, producing a spectrum, that depends on the mass.
You get much more information with this technique, but I have to put the sample in a machine, it's not remote.

This technique is used to check if oil is similar to a known oil which is good.

Prediction and understanding are 2 different things: I can understand that a tree is a tree without knowing the mechanism of photosyntesis

Being able to predict something will not always lead to understanding how it works
